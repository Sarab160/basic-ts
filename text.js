/*14. Guest List: If you could invite anyone, living or deceased, to dinner, who would you invite? Make a list that includes at least three people you’d like to
invite to dinner. Then use your list to print a message to each person, inviting them to dinner.

15. Changing Guest List: You just heard that one of your guests can’t make the
dinner, so you need to send out a new set of invitations. You’ll have to think of
someone else to invite.

• Start with your program from Exercise 14. Add a print statement at the
end of your program stating the name of the guest who can’t make it.

• Modify your list, replacing the name of the guest who can’t make it with
the name of the new person you are inviting.

• Print a second set of invitation messages, one for each person who is still
in your list.

16. More Guests: You just found a bigger dinner table, so now more space is
available. Think of three more guests to invite to dinner.

• Start with your program from Exercise 15. Add a print statement to the end of your program informing people that you found a
bigger dinner table.

• Add one new guest to the beginning of your array.

• Add one new guest to the middle of your array.
• Use append() to add one new guest to the end of your list.
• Print a new set of invitation messages, one for each person in your list.

17. Shrinking Guest List: You just found out that your new dinner table won’t arrive in time for the dinner, and you have space for only two guests.

• Start with your program from Exercise 16. Add a new line that prints a message saying that you can invite only two people for dinner.

• Remove guests from your list one at a time until only two names remain in your list. Each time you pop a name from your list, print
a message to that person letting them know you’re sorry you can’t invite them to dinner.

• Print a message to each of the two people still on your list, letting them know they’re still invited.

• Remove the last two names from your list, so you have an empty list. Print your list to make sure you actually have an empty list at the end
of your program.

18. Seeing the World: Think of at least five places in the world you’d like to visit.

• Store the locations in a array. Make sure the array is not in alphabetical order.

• Print your array in its original order.

• Print your array in alphabetical order without modifying the actual list.

• Show that your array is still in its original order by printing it.

• Print your array in reverse alphabetical order without changing the order of the original list.

• Show that your array is still in its original order by printing it again.

• Reverse the order of your list. Print the array to show that its
order has changed.

• Reverse the order of your list again. Print the list to show it’s back to its original order.

• Sort your array so it’s stored in alphabetical order. Print the array to show that its order has been changed.

• Sort to change your array so it’s stored in reverse alphabetical order. Print the list to show that its order has changed.

19. Dinner Guests: Working with one of the programs from Exercises 14 through 18, print a message indicating the numberof people you are inviting to dinner.
22. Intentional Error: If you haven’t received an array index error in one of your programs yet, try to make one happen. Change an index in one of your programs
to produce an index error. Make sure you correct the error before closing the program.
40. Album: Write a function called make_album() that builds a Object
describing a music album. The function should take in an artist name and an
album title, and it should return a Object containing these two pieces of
information. Use the function to make three dictionaries representing different
albums. Print each return value to show that Objects are storing the
album information correctly.
Add an optional parameter to make_album() that allows you to store the
number of tracks on an album. If the calling line includes a value for the number
of tracks, add that value to the album’s Object. Make at least one new
function call that includes the number of tracks on an album.
45. Cars: Write a function that stores information about a car in a Object.
The function should always receive a manufacturer and a model name. It
should then accept an arbitrary number of keyword arguments. Call the function
with the required information and two other name-value pairs, such as a
color or an optional feature.
Print the Object that’s returned to make sure all the information was
stored correctly.*/
